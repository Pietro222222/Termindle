An EpubReader in your terminal

(yeah, the code is not good. this is my very first real project in dart and the first time i coded in a couple of months, cmon. Any help would be good.);

Key Combinations: 
    J goes Up
    K goes down
    H goes to the left
    L goes to the right

    Ctrl + K alternates between text and chapter selection
    Ctrl + P alternates between the Reader and the library
